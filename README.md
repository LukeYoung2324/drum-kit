In this assignment, you will need to use JavaScript events to play sounds and change styles based on the user pressing certain keys on the keyboard.

You are given an HTML page with CSS already. All you need to do is write the JavaScript to wire it all up.

This is what the page should do:

1. When the user presses any of the keys showing on the page (A,S,D,F,G,H,J,K,L), play the audio associated to that key code.
2. When the sound is played, you need to add the "playing" class to the div that has that key code.
3. After the CSS transition is complete from step 2, remove the "playing" class from that div.
4. Make sure nothing happens when other keys are pressed on the page. Just the keys displaying on the page should trigger audio.

Remember to look at the lesson materials that were posted in canvas for week 25 for help. It goes over how the <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> tag works as well as CSS transitions and JavaScript events that will be needed for this assignment.
